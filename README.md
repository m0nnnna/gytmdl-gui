https://github.com/glomatico/gytmdl#configuration

Visit the section there and set up the CLI tools however you like and once it's complete this system will work.

Tested on Windows and MacOS however it should work on whatever runs Python. 

You will need to install 1 module 

$pip install tk

Once that is complete download the two Python files and run the launcher.py script.

Still WIP WebUI config.

for the WebUI you will need to install flask

$pip install flask

Once done run the app.py script this will launch a python dev server security does not exist for this you have been warned. 

visit localhost:5000 or once allowed through the firewall your devices IP:5000 and you will be able to paste links just like with the GUI program.
